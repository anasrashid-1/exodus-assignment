2. HTML Structure
The HTML structure consists of the main components:
Header: Navigation and contact information.
Main Section: Divided into two parts, showcasing a background image and a description/form container.

3. CSS Styles
CSS is used to style the webpage, creating an aesthetically pleasing and responsive design.

Header Styling: Styling for the navigation bar, logo, and contact information.

6. Media Queries
Media queries are implemented to adjust styles for different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless user experience across a range of devices.

  /* Media query styles for medium screens */
}

@media (max-width: 480px) {
  /* Media query styles for smaller screens */
}

@media (max-width: 350px) {
  /* Additional media query styles for even smaller screens */
}

7. Event Handling
JavaScript event handling is implemented for the "Show More" button, providing users with a dynamic way to reveal and hide additional content within the description section.
